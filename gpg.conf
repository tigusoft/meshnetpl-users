# mempo.org recommended gpg client configuration, config version 1.1 ; See http://mempo.org secure privacy.
#
# INSTALLATION: save this file on each user as:
# ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf
# DEPENDENCY: First also configure properly:
# only IF you want to use tor, then you need to set up first following: {
#   * tor client 
#   * use privoxy and configure it to use tor, edit: /etc/privoxy/config
#     and there uncomment (or add) line: forward-socks5   / 127.0.0.1:9050 .
# }
# TEST:
# * if you execute now command like "gpg -k" you will see nice long user ID
# * if you enabled Tor: try:  gpg  --recv-key "33D38C8797A7A35ED8BCAF1F4EBE40EAEFF62C7F" # will say if used .onion 
#
# This is based on: https://help.riseup.net/en/security/message-security/openpgp/best-practices

# Try to use the GnuPG-Agent. With this option, GnuPG first tries to connect to
# the agent before it asks for a passphrase.
use-agent

# IF you have Tor, then use this. Configure tor properly:
# You MUST enable IsolateDestPort and IsolateDestAddr in torrc or else it might LOWER security.
# (Or use dedicated SOCKSPort for GnuPG)
# -THEN- uncomment this line for new gpg:
### keyserver-options http-proxy=socks5-hostname://127.0.0.1:9050
# -OR- instead, for debian 7 etc, instead use this but first install privoxy and uncomment it's config upstream to use tor 9050
### keyserver-options http-proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8118

# if you enabled TOR in either the options with http-proxy above, then also use this tor server:
### keyserver hkp://qdigse2yzvuglcix.onion
keyserver pgp.mit.edu # comment this out if you uncomment the above .onion server

# Don't leak DNS, see https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/2846
